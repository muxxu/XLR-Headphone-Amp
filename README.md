## XLR Headphone Amplifier

In this repo you will find a little headphone amplifier mainly developed for in-ear monitoring. The amplifier is designed to be driven with symmetrical audio signals connected via XLR. It converts the symmetrical signals (Left and Right for stereo or only Right for mono) to an unsymmetrical signal. This signal is further amplified to drive a headphone.
